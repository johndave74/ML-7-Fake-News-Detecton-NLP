# ML-7-Fake-News-Detecton-NLP
This project aims to develop a robust fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. By analyzing text data, we can classify news articles as real or fake, helping to mitigate the impact of false information.

# Fake News Detection using NLP

## Overview
Fake news has become a significant problem in today's digital age, where misinformation spreads rapidly across various media platforms. This project aims to develop a robust fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. By analyzing text data, we can classify news articles as real or fake, helping to mitigate the impact of false information.

## Objectives
- To preprocess and clean textual data effectively
- To implement various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization
- To train and evaluate different machine learning models for fake news classification
- To visualize data insights and model performance using charts and plots

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques
- Implementation of machine learning models for fake news classification
- Performance evaluation and visualization
- Interactive data exploration using visualizations
- Model comparison and performance tuning

## Understanding NLP in Fake News Detection

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. In the context of fake news detection, NLP helps analyze textual data, identify patterns, and differentiate between authentic and misleading content.

### How NLP Works in This Project:
- Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to clean the data.
- Feature Extraction – Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to represent text numerically.
- Model Training – Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and deep learning models like LSTMs or transformers to classify news articles.
- Evaluation & Interpretation – Assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook fakecode.ipynb
```

## Sample Code
```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')...
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles categorized as real or fake. The data is preprocessed before feeding it into machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the model's performance, I use standard evaluation metrics such as:
- Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset.

## Results and Insights
This project provides insights into how different NLP techniques impact model performance. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and key findings are visualized to explain the model's decision-making process.
